Research Projects & Experience
======
* Fall 2025: Origins of SMGs via Metallicity Gradient
  * Status: In Prep.
  * Methods: Resolved SED fitting
    
* Spring 2025: Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?
  * Status: Under review (Independent Research Project)
  * Purpose: Investigate formation mechanisms of Sub-millimeter Galaxies (SMGs)
    using morphological diagnostic tools
  * Conclusion: Secular evolution takes precedence over mergers , in which merger
    acts only as a booster for star formation activities , suggesting that filamentary
    gas inflow plays a key role in bulge formation.

* Autumn 2024: Exploration of the Resolved SED fitting technique
  
* Summer 2024: Does LSTM excel in prediction of violatility of the stock market?(Class project)
