Hey there, my name is Jacky Siu-Wang Chan (陳瀟弘) , a third-year master student majored in astrophysics studying at the University of the Science and Technology of China(USTC). My research interests include probing the formation pathway for the sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) at high redshift , the correlation between obscured active galatic nuclei (AGN) and SMGs etc.

I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD’s degree starting from Fall 2026 , and I would like to collaborate with a principal investigator (PI) who is interested in high-z galaxy formation and evolution , chemical evolution ,  and specialized in the JWST NIRSpec (IFU) data and ALMA spectroscopic data. And these data and techniques serve vital and indispensable parts for my further research projects in the followings years.

I got some unresolved question for someone to answer: What's the role of stellar bar at high-z galaxy evolution ? Boosting or quenching the star formation activity at the center ? How can we understand correlations between the AGN and the SMGs at high-z ?
